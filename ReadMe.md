# About Coinie
I have created a web application called Coinie using React.js that allows users to register, login, and monitor the prices of various cryptocurrencies. Here are the key features of the application:

1. Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in to the application, providing secure access to their personal profile.

2. Cryptocurrency Price Monitoring: Users can track the prices of different cryptocurrencies in real-time. They can view the current price, as well as the price changes over the past hours, days, months, and years.

3. Detailed Information: Users can access comprehensive information about each cryptocurrency, including its name, symbol, market cap, and trading volume.

4. Favorites: Users can save their favorite cryptocurrencies to their personal profile for quick access. This feature allows them to monitor their preferred cryptocurrencies easily.

5. Theme Switching: The application provides a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between dark mode and light mode, based on their preference.

6. Test Mode: Users can explore the process of buying cryptocurrencies in a test environment. This feature enables users to familiarize themselves with the buying process without using real funds.

Technology Stack:
- Front-end: React.js
- Back-end: Firebase (for user authentication and data storage)
- API Consumption: Axios (to fetch data from Coingecko.com API)

Development Time:
I spent approximately five days creating this web application while managing my time as a student. The initial UI design was inspired by a Behance project, and I took it upon myself to bring the design to life by coding it and adding the necessary functionality.

Overall, this web application provides users with an intuitive interface to stay updated on cryptocurrency prices, manage their favorite cryptocurrencies, and experience a seamless buying process in a test environment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
